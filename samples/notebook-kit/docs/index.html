    The **future of notebooks** 📓🔮 is here. We're building the next generation of Observable Notebooks, and we're excited to share a technology preview that you can start using today. 🚀
  </script>
  <script id="65" type="text/markdown">
    Specifically, we're releasing two things:

    1. [**Observable Notebook Kit**](./kit) - An open file format for notebooks, and accompanying tooling for generating static sites
    2. [**Observable Desktop**](./desktop) - A macOS desktop application for editing notebooks as local files, and with a radical new approach to AI
  </script>
  <script id="67" type="text/markdown">
    This is a technology preview, meaning our work isn't done, but we would like you to try it out and give us your feedback. We're taking a local-first approach: our plan is to bring these new notebooks, editor, and AI to the web in the near future, providing seamless collaboration and sharing through the Observable platform.
  </script>
  <script id="68" type="text/markdown">
    ---

    ## Why we're doing this
  </script>
  <script id="27" type="text/markdown">
    Our goals for Notebooks 2.0 are:

    - **Support file-based workflows** so you can do more with notebooks
    - **Adopt vanilla JavaScript** so notebooks are easier to learn, use, & reuse
    - **Modernize notebooks** to support the latest syntax & libraries
    - **Render notebooks as fast static sites** for the best reading experience
  </script>
  <script id="29" type="text/markdown">
    To achieve these goals, we've developed an open **notebook file format** and are releasing **Observable Notebook Kit**, an open-source command-line interface (and Vite plugin) for generating static sites from notebooks. You can use Notebook Kit for self-hosting and continuous deployment of notebooks, to deeply integrate notebooks into custom web applications, and more.
  </script>
  <script id="30" type="text/markdown">
    In addition to growing notebooks as reusable, extensible technology, we want to improve the experience of authoring notebooks. We are therefore also developing **Observable Desktop**, a desktop application for editing notebooks that brings the magic ✨ of Observable Notebooks to file-based workflows.
  </script>
  <script id="31" type="text/markdown">
    Our goals for a next-generation notebook editor are:

    - **Seamlessly integrate AI** to boost creativity, learning, and productivity
    - **Streamline editing** for a clean look and feel, focused on coding
  </script>
  <script id="71" type="text/markdown">
    Notebooks are the _perfect_ environment for coding with AI. The instant feedback you get with reactive coding, the lightweight composability and flexibility of cells, the ability to inspect and tinker to understand what the code is doing, the infinite variety of importable open-source libraries at your fingertips --- notebooks enable AI to perform as a more effective teacher and muse, inviting you to collaborate with it, rather than treating it as a black box code generator.
  </script>
  <script id="70" type="text/markdown">
    Eventually, this new editor and AI will be coming to the web, giving you the same great authoring experience for notebooks --- whether you want the convenience of instant sharing via an Observable workspace, or you prefer to work with local files and manage collaboration yourself (say through git).
  </script>
  <script id="28" type="text/markdown">
    <aside>The page you’re currently reading is a notebook! This documentation is hosted on GitHub. <a href="https://github.com/observablehq/notebook-kit/edit/main/docs/index.html">Edits</a> are welcome.</aside>

    You won't need Observable Desktop to author notebooks --- you can author notebooks in your preferred text editor, and then preview or build them using Notebook Kit. But our goal is to build the best-in-class editor for notebooks that supercharges your productivity with AI, combined with instant collaboration and sharing in Observable workspaces, together with [Observable Canvases](https://observablehq.com/canvases/) for rapid, cross-functional, visual exploration and presentation of data. We'd love for you to use our open-source, but we're ready for your business, too.

    ## What's new
  </script>
  <script id="7" type="text/markdown">
    ### Notebook file format

    The heart of Notebooks 2.0 is a simple, human-readable, and human-editable file format. It's based on HTML, which means you get nice editing affordances in today's text editors without needing special plugins. In addition, it's easy to review diffs when storing notebooks in source control, to search, to find-and-replace, and countless other workflows.
  </script>
  <script id="34" type="text/markdown">
    <aside>If you use Observable Desktop to edit notebooks, you don't need to understand the notebook file format. But we're making the format open so anyone can write tools that work with notebooks.</aside>

    The Observable Notebook file format consists of:

    - a <code class="language-html">&lt;notebook&gt;</code> root element,
    - an optional <code class="language-html">&lt;title&gt;</code> element, and
    - one <code class="language-html">&lt;script&gt;</code> element per cell.
  </script>
  <script id="13" type="text/markdown">
    Here's a simple "hello world" notebook to demonstrate:

    ```html
    <!doctype html>
    <notebook>
      <title>Hello, world!</title>
      <script id="1" type="text/markdown">
        # Hello, world!
      <\/script>
      <script id="2" type="module" pinned>
        1 + 2
      <\/script>
    </notebook>
    ```
  </script>
  <script id="82" type="text/markdown">
    See the [Notebook Kit documentation](./kit) for more on the notebook file format.
  </script>
  <script id="6" type="text/markdown">
    ### Vanilla JavaScript

    You no longer have to learn a nonstandard dialect, [Observable JavaScript](https://observablehq.com/@observablehq/observable-javascript~0), to use Observable Notebooks; they're now vanilla JavaScript. This also makes it easier to reuse code between notebooks and other web applications.
  </script>
  <script id="40" type="text/markdown">
    <aside>Notebooks 2.0 supports an Observable JavaScript cell mode for backwards compatibility, so you can migrate to vanilla JavaScript at your own pace.</aside>

    If you don't know Observable JavaScript, this change will be largely invisible --- JavaScript will "just work" like you expect. But if you're familiar with past notebooks, here are some highlights:

    - You declare top-level variables in cells with standard <code class="language-js">const</code> and <code class="language-js">let</code>, and cells can now expose as many top-level variables as they want rather than being limited to just one.
    - You display content with the <code class="language-js">display(…)</code> function, and cells can display multiple things, even asynchronously. You likewise define reactive inputs with the <code class="language-js">view(…)</code> function, and cells can have multiple reactive inputs rather than being limited to just one.
    - You import libraries from npm (and JSR, the web, and local modules) with standard static <code class="language-js">import</code> declarations rather than being limited to `require` and dynamic imports.
  </script>
  <script id="41" type="text/markdown">
    See the [Notebooks system guide](./system-guide) for more on JavaScript in notebooks. And see the gallery below for lots of examples.
  </script>
  <script id="9" type="text/markdown">
    ### Themes and greater customizability

    People love to customize the look-and-feel of notebooks --- maybe you prefer a sans serif font, more pink 🦄, dark mode, whatever. Notebooks 2.0 allow styling via custom stylesheets. And notebooks are now "full bleed", meaning they extend to the full width of the window rather than being limited to a central column. You can even [animate colorful blobs as the background](./ex/animated-background).
  </script>
  <script id="43" type="text/markdown">
    To make customization easier, we've also brought themes from Observable Framework back to notebooks. You can choose from a variety of beautiful, built-in colorways, suitable for both light and dark modes.
  </script>
  <script id="47" type="text/markdown">
    And when building static sites from notebooks, you can further customize the appearance of your built notebooks by adding a custom page template, say to add a header and footer. With themes and page templates together, you have complete control over the appearance of your notebooks.
  </script>
  <script id="48" type="text/markdown">
    ### Modernized standard library

    Notebooks 2.0 upgrades the built-ins available by default in notebooks. This includes upgrading core functions that aren't strictly backwards compatible, namely the `md`, `html`, and `tex` tagged template literals that power Markdown, HTML, and ${tex`\TeX`} cells. In Notebooks 2.0, these are now powered by the latest versions of [markdown-it](https://github.com/markdown-it/markdown-it), [Hypertext Literal](https://github.com/observablehq/htl), and [${tex`\KaTeX`}](https://katex.org/).
  </script>
  <script id="11" type="text/markdown">
    <aside>We still provide <code>require</code> as a built-in to improve backwards compatibility, but it’s simply a wrapper around dynamic <code class="language-js">import</code>.</aside>

    Notebooks 2.0 also fully embraces JavaScript modules, removing built-in support for `require` (asynchronous module definitions) --- the now-antiquated way of loading JavaScript modules that predates <code class="language-js">import</code>. Thanks to vanilla JavaScript syntax, you can use standard static import declarations or dynamic import expressions. And you can import libraries from npm (`npm:`), JSR (`jsr:`), local modules, or remote servers. You can also import existing Observable notebooks (`observable:`).
  </script>
  <script id="12" type="text/markdown">
    ### Notebooks as static sites

    When you want to share your notebooks as a static site, install the open-source Notebook Kit:

    ```sh
    npm add @observablehq/notebook-kit
    ```
  </script>
  <script id="83" type="text/markdown">
    Then define a couple scripts in your `package.json`:

    ```json
    {
      "dependencies": {
        "@observablehq/notebook-kit": "^%VITE_VERSION%"
      },
      "scripts": {
        "docs:preview": "notebooks preview --root docs",
        "docs:build": "notebooks build --root docs -- docs/*.html"
      }
    }
    ```
  </script>
  <script id="77" type="text/markdown">
    Then run the `notebooks build` command:

    ```sh
    npm run docs:build
    ```
  </script>
  <script id="79" type="text/markdown">
    This generates a `.observable/dist` folder containing the built site, which you can then deploy to your preferred static site hosting service, such as GitHub Pages, Vercel, or Netlify.
  </script>
  <script id="46" type="text/markdown">
    When building notebooks, we use static generation for Markdown and HTML cells: static content is statically rendered. We "bake" the results of static [database queries](./databases), too. Static generation improves the user experience by accelerating the first contentful paint, and by reducing reflow during page load --- your page appears instantly. It's good for SEO, too, because static content is now readable by search engines without JavaScript.
  </script>
  <script id="19" type="text/markdown">
    <aside>You can also use the new Vite plugin directly if you want to integrate notebooks into your existing Vite-based application.</aside>

    The `build` command is implemented on top of [Vite](https://vite.dev), making it incredibly fast. If you prefer to author notebooks in a text editor rather than using Observable Desktop, you can use Vite's preview server for a live preview as you edit.

    ```sh
    npm run docs:preview
    ```

    See the [Notebook Kit documentation](./kit) for more.
  </script>
  <script id="52" type="text/markdown">
    When we bring the next-generation notebook editor to the web, you won't need terminal commands to share notebooks --- you'll be able to share notebooks directly from the editor. We'll also work on making it easy to transition between local and web-based development. But we're providing this open-source tooling to give you flexibility and to enable deeper, custom notebook integrations. You should be able to do whatever you want with your notebooks.
  </script>

    ## We want your feedback
