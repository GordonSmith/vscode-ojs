    # Apportionment of seats in the European Parliament

    Evolution of EU countries relative apportionment of seats at the European Parliament, colored by year of accession. Although the areaY mark implicitly stacks values, we chose to make the [stack](https://observablehq.com/plot/transforms/stack) transform explicit, in order to minimize the difference between the two marks ([areaY](https://observablehq.com/plot/marks/area) and [textY](https://observablehq.com/plot/marks/text)). Original [D3 visualization](https://observablehq.com/@lucguillemot/apportionment-of-seats-in-the-european-parliament) created by [Luc Guillemot](/@lucguillemot). Data: [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apportionment_in_the_European_Parliament).

    The original dataset (**eu**) is a wide array, with one member state per row, and as many columns as there are dates. We make it _tidy_ with arquero's fold operator, so that each row of the **members** array is an observation: _state_, _date_, and number of _seats_. The _joined_ column is used to color the state's ribbon.
